# quickHTML

A bash script that automates HTML5 boilerplate along with Javascript and CSS files.

Just run the script with one argument, which will be the name
of the new directory. Once it's done, cd into said directory
to see an index.html file, a js folder containing a main.js file,
and a stylesheets folder containing a styles.css file. Each is
linked in the automated html boilerplate, so everything you need
to get started on a basic website is included.
